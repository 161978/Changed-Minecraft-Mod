# Textures
Block and item textures are typically 16x16 or 32x32. They are meant to be stylized in a manner similar to Minecraft, as to fit with the vanilla texture pack. Textures are named in English, with words being split by underscores (\_).

Entity textures are crafted when 3D modeling said entity. Entity textures are designed with the same pixel density as vanilla Minecraft mobs, but high object count models have a larger texture canvas than others.
