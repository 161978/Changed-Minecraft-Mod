# Source Code
The actual code for this project is the trickiest to contribute on. Those who know their way around Java and Minecraft modding are welcome to fork and pull their changes they've developed.

# Tips
- Don't hook computationally heavy code to ticking objects, as that can reduce TPS (not good).
- While some of the code is buggy, other parts can be "duplicated" and modified to fulfill your own need. (Copying block/item registry code, getting player data, etc).
- Make sure your code doesn't reimplement something already implemented in the project.
